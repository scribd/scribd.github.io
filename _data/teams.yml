  about: |
    Web team at Scribd is responsible for core business metrics such as user
    acquisition, SEO, on-boarding and core product experience. We collaborate with
    Product Managers, Design Engineers, Data Scientists, QA and Project Managers in
    cross-functional teams to build an amazing product. We conduct many experiments
    (A/B tests) to understand our hypotheses and user behavior. Each and every
    experiment is very valuable, regardless of the outcome, as we get to learn the
    impact of our product development on the users. The scale of these experiments
    is also fairly large with 100+ million documents, 300+ million visitors every
    month (and growing) and 1.2 million (and growing) paid subscribers.
