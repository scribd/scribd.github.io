This summer I was able to present at [Airflow
Summit](https://airflowsummit.org/) on the progress we have made migrating from
our legacy orchestrator to [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) in the
cloud. The video is available on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHDlD-bMM3c) and embedded below.
