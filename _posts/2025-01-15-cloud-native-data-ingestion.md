One of the major themes for Infrastructure Engineering over the past couple
years has been higher reliability and better operational efficiency. In a
recent session with the [Delta Lake](https://delta.io) project I was able to
share the work led Kuntal Basu and a number of other people to _dramatically_
improve the efficiency and reliability of our online data ingestion pipeline.


> Join Kuntal Basu, Staff Infrastructure Engineer, and R. Tyler Croy, Principal
> Engineer at Scribd, Inc. as they take you behind the scenes of Scribd’s data
> ingestion setup. They’ll break down the architecture, explain the tools, and
> walk you through how they turned off-the-shelf solutions into a robust
> pipeline.
